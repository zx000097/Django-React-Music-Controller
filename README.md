# Django-React-Music-Controller

This is following Tech With Tim's tutorial here in https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j&si=po35HCTil9uLDJz2, with some modification.

In the tutorial, Tim was writing the frontend part within an django app. I could not get the Babel setup to work so I had to separated the react part with the backend by using a different port 3000. They communicate using the [axios](https://axios-http.com) library.

Furthermore, Tim was using the React class components, while I use function components.
