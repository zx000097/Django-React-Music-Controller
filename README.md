# Django-React-Music-Controller

This is following Tech With Tim's tutorial here in https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j&si=po35HCTil9uLDJz2, with some modification.
I could not get the Babel setup to work so I had to separated the react and django app with different ports, and communicate using the [axios](https://axios-http.com) library.

For frontend, I am using function components in the React code, while the tutorial was mainly written using class components.
